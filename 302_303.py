Dictionaries for data science
For this exercise, you'll use what you've learned about the zip() function and combine two lists into a dictionary.

These lists are actually extracted from a bigger dataset file of world development indicators from the World Bank. For pedagogical purposes, we have pre-processed this dataset into the lists that you'll be working with.

The first list feature_names contains header names of the dataset and the second list row_vals contains actual values of a row from the dataset, corresponding to each of the header names.
Instructions

    Create a zip object by calling zip() and passing to it feature_names and row_vals. Assign the result to zipped_lists.
    Create a dictionary from the zipped_lists zip object by calling dict() with zipped_lists. Assign the resulting dictionary to rs_dict.

Writing a function to help you
Suppose you needed to repeat the same process done in the previous exercise to many, many rows of data. Rewriting your code again and again could become very tedious, repetitive, and unmaintainable.

In this exercise, you will create a function to house the code you wrote earlier to make things easier and much more concise. Why? This way, you only need to call the function and supply the appropriate lists to create your dictionaries! Again, the lists feature_names and row_vals are preloaded and these contain the header names of the dataset and actual values of a row from the dataset, respectively.
Instructions

    Define the function lists2dict() with two parameters: first is list1 and second is list2.
    Return the resulting dictionary rs_dict in lists2dict().
    Call the lists2dict() function with the arguments feature_names and row_vals. Assign the result of the function call to rs_fxn.

# Define lists2dict()
def lists2dict(list1, list2):
    """Return a dictionary where list1 provides
    the keys and list2 provides the values."""

    # Zip lists: zipped_lists
    zipped_lists = zip(list1, list2)

    # Create a dictionary: rs_dict
    rs_dict = dict(zipped_lists)

    # Return the dictionary
    return rs_dict

# Call lists2dict: rs_fxn
rs_fxn = lists2dict(feature_names, row_vals)

# Print rs_fxn
print(rs_fxn)
